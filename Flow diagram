Flow diagram
	To represent the algorithm more directly and easier to view and understand,
	we need the flow diagram to show the whole process.
	
	Consists of boxes and arrows, the flow diagram show us how the process works in sequent order.
	
	In our cases, it shows the whole process for a Student, an Administrator or even the guest to 
	view the Course Sequence of a Software Engineering program and may be able to edit it by their 
	preferences. 
	
	The flow diagram has 3 main users, which are Student, Administrator,and guest. Each user can result in different function 
	accordingly. The Course Sequence system will show the sorted diagram with original/edited version
	depended on the requirment from the user. We also provide the choice of downloading the course sequence for the user for their further use.
